### constraints on neutron star fundamental-mode oscillation frequencies from astronomical data
philippe landry (pgjlandry@gmail.com) 05/2024

*dynamical tides that excite the internal oscillation modes of a neutron star are an important aspect of the tidal interaction of a compact binary during inspiral. what is the most probable fundamental-mode frequency in the merging neutron star population? how detectable is it with current or future-generation gravitational-wave detectors?*

*this repository contains python scripts for constraining the f-mode frequencies of neutron stars in merging binaries. the constraints enable the most common f-mode frequency in the astrophysical population to be estimated, such that its measurability can be assessed.*
